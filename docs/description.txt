Only one audio/video will be played at time, all another audio/video will be paused and a kind of queue will be created.

Problem:
You listen to music, someone send you a funny video on youtube and you open it.
Now you have playing at the same time your music and a funny video.

Solution:
- Return to the tab with your music, pause it
- Again go back to the youtube tab, rewind the video to the beginning
- When the video ends, you need open tab with your music and continue listening to it

Good solution:
Just install this extension and it will do everything for you. How it works:
- When any content (audio or video) start playing, the already playing audio/video will be paused
- When you stop the current audio/video previously paused content continuing to play

So, it means, that a queue of audio/video is formed. And only one content can be played in a one moment of time.

Currently, such providers are supported:
- Youtube
- Vkontakte (audio only)
- Yandex music
- Html audio / video

PS: write in the comments which sites/providers of audio you would like to have added. 
Also this is only alpha version so I will be really glad if you write about some bugs or features (that you want) :)
